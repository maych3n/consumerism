Introduction
</div>
<div class="paragraphs">
    Ever since humankind possessed the power of purchase, since has been the ever-evolving process of consumer culture. Today, however, we are not as concerned with having our physiological needs met, as we are overcome with the variety of options available to us. Every option is made more and more tempting through the inviting arms of a compelling practice known as advertising. But if we take into account the current state of consumer culture further being solidified through the means of advertising, how is the visual culture influencing and targeting consumer behavior? Furthermore, based on this trajectory, what are the potential future developments in consumer culture?”

    Advertising's Impact on Consumer Behavior
    </div>
    <div class="paragraphs">
        Advertising has a significant impact on consumer behavior, influencing their preferences, attitudes, and purchasing decisions through various persuasive techniques and media channels. Advertising is a form of communication between a product and a large number of people. Advertising will leave an impression on the minds of consumers. Consumers will look out for the product when making a purchase decision or may make a purchase decision immediately when they see an advertisement. Advertising helps consumers become familiar with the product and brand as a whole. “If a consumer is going to the supermarket to buy groceries, they will prefer a brand that they know about over the other unrecognized brands on the shelf. If the consumer can align with or connect with the company and its vision, they may also try out new products from the brand.”[1] Nowadays, advertising has many different forms, such as billboards, text, magazines, newspapers, television, and radio. In the latest technology, there are more advertising mediums such as email, online websites, and social media. Advertising utilizes different media channels to reach consumers. By targeting specific demographics through these channels, advertising can increase its impact on consumer behavior by reaching the right audience at the right time. With so many forms of advertising, advertising builds brand awareness and a positive image for brands and products. As advertising continues, people become more familiar with brands and products, consumers may choose a particular product when they make a purchase decision, thus influencing consumer behavior. “Advertising has in fact changed consumer behavior from buying based on needs to purchasing based on wants. Advertising has transformed the concept of ‘wants’ to ‘needs’, thereby creating a mentality of wasteful consumption.”[2] Therefore, advertising influences people's consumption behavior, stimulates people's consumption desire, raises people's consumption level, and also leads to over-consumption in modern society.

                Conclusion
 </div>
  <div class="paragraphs">
    In conclusion, advertising intentionally dominates consumer behavior, shaping materialistic values and fostering a culture of consumption. The interplay between advertising and visual culture further reinforces this domination. The potential of augmented reality integration and hyper-targeted campaigns poses new possibilities and challenges in consumer culture. While AR has the potential to change the way we see consumer culture, hyper-targeted campaigns raise concerns about privacy, manipulation, and ethical considerations in decision-making. As consumers become more conscious about ethical and sustainable consumption, advertisers face challenges in aligning their campaigns with changing consumer values and expectations. It is imperative for scholars, practitioners, and consumers alike to critically examine the impact of advertising on consumer culture and strive for more ethical and sustainable consumption practices.
