        Hyper Targetted Advertising
        </div>
        <div class="paragraphs">
            With the onset of the digital age, advertisers, all industries alike, possess an incomparable means of making their product known to any consumer with a digital device, so much so that with the information gained from an individual's devices, advertisers can use this information to predict what a consumer would be inclined to purchase. However convenient, this method does raise a few eyebrows when thinking about the individual's privacy. The double-edged sword that is ‘hyper-targeted advertising’ has its benefits but it also has its drawbacks.  Although it's undoubtedly so that advertising is increasing at a remarkable rate so is the awareness regarding data collection. In the court of public opinion, or at least by a survey conducted by the Pew Research Center,  a staggering 81% of surveyed Americans felt that the risks associated with the collection of data by advertising firms outweighed its advantages. But even now we are not fully aware of the full extent of the data being collected, in an investigation conducted by Saikat Guha from Microsoft and Bin Cheng and Paul Francis from the Max Planck Institute for Software Systems discovered that tech firms, in this Facebook, which are tasked with collecting data on behalf of advertising industry firms can even go as far as informing advertisers of aspects like sexuality, even when aren't disclosing their sexuality explicitly. Furthermore, while one of the merits of hyper-targeted advertising is that delivers content tailored to you as an individual, it could also perpetuate societal inequalities and reinforce pre-existing biases; for example, A study from USC discovered that targeted ads for high-paying jobs were more likely to be shown to men than to women furthering gender-based discrimination in pay gap. With a practice like hyper-targeted advertising, the only way it can function is by transparency with data collection a choice with what data is being collected, and more importantly, data being collected in an ethical manner.
